= Zero page relocation

[NOTE]

  This proposed is entirely based on David Horner's work, written up by Tariq
  
This proposal adds new CSRs to control the behaviour of unusual encodings, which are not very useful in general, and changes the behaviour to make it more useful.


== zero page JALR

=== CSR

* `MZPJALR[0] = enable`
* `MZPJALR[XLEN-1:10] = base`  # on 1K boundaries
* `MZPJALR[9:8] -> scale`
* `MZPJALR[7:1]` - *reserved*

scale values are 8,16,32 and 64 encoded as 0,1,2,and 3 

[NOTE]

  The https://github.com/riscv/riscv-code-size-reduction/blob/master/ISA%20proposals/Huawei/table%20jump.adoc[table jump proposal] reduces the usefulness of this

== Behaviour

If `MZPJALR.enable=0` then the behaviour of `JALR rd, offset(x0)` is as originally; that is with a scale of 1 and x0 set to zero.

If `MZPJALR.enable=1` then the behaviour of `JALR rd, offset(x0)` takes on a new meaning. 

. `MZPJALR.base` is substituted for `x0`.
. `offset` is scaled by `MZPJALR.scale` before use to give a bigger range.

Therefore the behaviour is:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----

jalr rd, offset(x0);# executes as jalr rd, MZPJALR.base+offset*scale

----

This gives a region of 16K to 128K which can always be accessed by 
`jalr x0,offset` from anywhere in the address map. 
Note that `c.jalr` is not affected, since `x0` is explicitly excluded.
Thus there is no 16-bit form without explicitly defining one.

=== Further Considerations

Propose a 16bit variant. 
Potentially the proposed 16bit TBLJMP could map to these 32bit versions.  

== Zero Page load/store

=== CSR

* `MZPLDST[0] = enable`
* `MZPLDST[XLEN-1:10] = base`  # on 1K boundaries
* `MZPLDST[9:1]` - *reserved*

== Behaviour

If `MZPLDST.enable=0` then the behaviour of `[lq|ld|ldu|lw|lwu|lh|lhu|lb|lbu] rd, offset(x0)` is unchanged.

If `MZPLDST.enable=0` then the behaviour of `[sq|sd|sw|sh|sb] rs2, offset(x0)` is unchanged.

If `MZPLDST.enable=1` then the behaviour of `[lq|ld|ldu|lw|lwu|lh|lhu|lb|lbu] rd, offset(x0)` expands takes on a new meaning.

If `MZPLDST.enable=1` then the behaviour of `[sq|sd|sw|sh|sb] rs2, offset(x0)` takes on a new meaning.

Note, when `MZPLDST.base` = 0, even when MZPLDST.enable=1,  
    then the behaviour of `[lb|lbu|sb] rd, offset(x0)` is unchanged.

If `MZPLDST.enable=1` then 

. `MZPLDST.base` is substituted for `x0`.
. the under utilised unaligned bits of `offset` are used to extend the range of half and larger data types.
. the unextended range is unchanged [the same as when enable=0
. the extended range is to be contigous and
. the overlap of the ranges per data size agree with the unextended range.

.. w-offset [11,*1,*0,10:2]<<2
.. d-offset [11,*2,*1,*0,10:3]<<3
.. q-offset [11,*3,*2,*1,*0,10:4]<<4)

Where [*bit] denotes ([bit] xor [11])
That is a zero inserted bit yields a result the same as the sign.
Thus aligned addresses when enamble = 0 are exactly the same as when enable = 1.

Note: keeping bit [11] as the sign bit of the offset is consistent with all RVI instructions.

Note: That each bit location in the immediate fireld affects at most 2 resultant locations in the offset. 


* `offset` for `lb[u] rd, b-offset(x0)` is unchanged, giving a 4KB range
* `offset` for `lh[u] rd, h-offset(x0)` giving an 8KB range
* `offset` for `lw[u] rd, w-offset(x0)` giving a 16KB range
* `offset` for `ld[u] rd, d-offset(x0)` giving a 32KB range
* `offset` for `lq    rd, q-offset(x0)` giving a 64KB range

The same extension of the offset occurs for stores {sb,sh,sw,sd,sq} as well.

Therefore the behaviour is:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----

lb[u] rd, offset(x0);# executes lb[u] rd, MZPLDST.base+offset[11:0]
lh[u] rd, offset(x0);# executes lh[u] rd, MZPLDST.base+(offset[11,*0,10:1]<<1)
lw[u] rd, offset(x0);# executes lw[u] rd, MZPLDST.base+(offset[11,*1,*0,10:2]<<2)
ld[u] rd, offset(x0);# executes ld[u] rd, MZPLDST.base+(offset[11,*2,*1,*0,10:3]<<3)
lq    rd, offset(x0);# executes lq    rd, MZPLDST.base+(offset[11,*3,*2,*1,*0,10:4]<<4)

sh rs1, offset(x0);# executes as sh rs1, MZPLDST.base+(offset[11,*0,10:1]<<1)

== Application

If compiling with the GCC option `-fstack-protector-strong` then every function in the Huawei IoT code has these:


[source,sourceCode,text]
----
 e04a5e:  00f00437                lui     s0,0xf00
 e04a62:  02c42783                lw      a5,44(s0) # f0002c <__stack_chk_guard>
----

Some functions also have this (sometimes it's a 32-bit sequence to call it)

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
10bef2c:     ffd47097                auipc   ra,0xffd47
10bef30:     f52080e7                jalr    -174(ra) # e05e7e <__stack_chk_fail>
----

These could be replaced by zero-page `jalr` and `lw` meaning that 64-bit sequences would never be required. Additionally table jump can be used for the calls to `__stack_chk_fail`

== Link Time Optimisation

The linker should be able to make use of this feature, so the compiler doesn't need to know about it.

== Context save/restore

Whether `MZPJALR/MZPLDST` are saved and restored on a context switch is platform defined. 
They could be set globally for all contexts to use, or they could be set separately.

RV64 systems particularly benefit from this feature as any region in 64bit memory is addressable in only 32bits.


It is not now known how extensively this feature will be.
This scheme is primarily targetting small embedded cores providing a low cost immediate benefit in the M and M/U modes.

However, it should be designed to work well even with Hypervisor systems.  

This feature cooperates well with virtual memory when the result of add of base plus offset is a virtual address.
However, page addressing can already map the two pages centered on virtual zero to any physical address space, granted not at a 1K granularity.

It is thus not necessary to have a distinct System csr SZPLDST for M/S/U systems.

== Virtual memory and PMP

The resulting address from the zero page instructions are virtual addresses where virtual memory is implemented and enabled. 

They are also subject to PMP checks, where the PMP is implemented and enabled.

Therefore the generated addresses are handled identically to any other load/store or fetch addresses.

== Disassembly

The disassembly for this should be modified to make it clear that zero page mode is in use. For example:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
lw a1, 0x100(x0)
----

maybe should disassemble as

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
lw a1, 0x400(zp)
----

to show it's relative to the zero-page pointer, and with the immediate scale, and also maybe use a different mnemonic:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
zlw a1, 0x400
----

Any specific disassembly requirement will require adding a flag to the ELF file, or change to the ELF file format to add a new ELF section. TBD.

== Caveat

If a SoC has memory allocated Â±2KB around address zero (i.e. the bottom and top 2KB of the address map), and the compiler / handwritten assembler reference it by using load/stores/`JALR` which reference x0 then the zero page mode may be limitted to base = 0 on  that platform.
For other SoC that do not have valid memory support around zero, this provides a mechanism to reloacate to parts of the memeory map that do support load/store and/or code execution.
